# Chaos Theory in Financial Markets

## Overview
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook from a guest lecture given by [Dr. Nam Le](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/62gh5p/doctor-nam-le) at the University of Southampton, focusing on the application of Chaos Theory in Financial Markets. The lecture covers a range of topics, including Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), Fractal Market Hypothesis, Hurst Exponent, and the implementation of various trading strategies in Python using real-world financial data.

## Objectives
- Introduce the concept of chaos theory and its implications for financial markets.
- Explore the limitations of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and introduce alternative models like the Fractal Market Hypothesis.
- Demonstrate the calculation and interpretation of the Hurst Exponent as a measure of market predictability.
- Implement and assess the performance of mean-reversion and trend-following strategies on historical stock data.

## Contents
- `Chaos_Theory_in_Financial_Market.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the lecture material, Python code for analysis and trading strategy implementation, and discussion of results.
